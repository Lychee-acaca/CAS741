\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition based on the principle
of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This principle supports design for
change, because the ``secrets'' that each module hides represent likely future
changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC, where modifications are frequent,
especially during initial development as the solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.
The MG specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow
both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.
The potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the relevant
  modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to check
  for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the system
  in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section \ref{SecChange} lists
the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section
\ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that was constructed according
to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection} specifies the connections
between the software requirements and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a
detailed description of the modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two
traceability matrices. One checks the completeness of the design against the
requirements provided in the SRS. The other shows the relation between
anticipated changes and the modules. Section \ref{SecUse} describes the use
relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two categories.
Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and unlikely changes
are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSIIR}:] The types of specified
IIR filters.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acIO}:] The input and output
format.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMath}:] Specific
implementation methods of various mathematical functions.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acLog}:] The log format.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}

to implement R-wave detection task.

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the module.
The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do without
documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means
the module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided.
\citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if correct
execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in its
specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which the
correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.

Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be
seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  The Error Handler module
and Logger module with dotted arrows in the Figure \ref{FigUH} indicate that
they are referenced by all other modules except themselves and the
Hardware-Hiding Module.  Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and
usable subset of the system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy
are essentially simpler because they use modules from the lower levels.
