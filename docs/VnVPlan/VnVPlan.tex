% \wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
% However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation
% technique that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a
% \textbf{feasible} plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time
% and team available.  If the full plan cannot be completed during the time
% available, it can either be modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is
% to add a section describing what work has been completed and what work is
% still planned for the future.}

% \wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but
% before the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing
% cannot initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the

This document outlines the Verification and Validation Plan (VnV) for \progname,
structured into four main sections.  General Information includes the summary,
objectives, challenge level and extras relevant to the VnV process.  Plan
details the verification strategy for the SRS, Design, VnV, and Implementation
phases, along with the use of automated testing and verification tools, as well
as software validation plan. System Tests verify both functional and
nonfunctional requirements at the system level, ensuring the overall system
meets its intended behavior.  Unit Test Description covers validating individual
modules against both functional and nonfunctional requirements.  This plan
ensures a comprehensive and systematic approach to verifying and validating the
system before deployment.

\section{General Information}

This section will provide the project summary and objectives for this document.

\subsection{Summary}

This project focuses on reimplementing the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for R-wave
detection in ECG signal processing.  This implementation will automatically
derive all filter parameters based on requirements without relying on external
libraries.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives of this VnV plan include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Build confidence in the software correctness.
  \item Test robustness against noisy ECG signals.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The objectives of this VnV plan do not include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item User experience testing for a graphical interface or integration into
  medical workflow systems.
  \item Clinical trials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

This is a problem with a general-level challenge. Doxygen will be widely used to
generate the API documentation.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

In the Verification and Validation Plan, we reference the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) \citep{SRS} as the primary document. The SRS outlines the
systemâ€™s requirements, forming the foundation for all verification activities.
It ensures that the VnV process is aligned with the specified functional and
nonfunctional requirements.

\section{Plan}

This section provides plans to verify SRS, Design, VnV, and Implementation. In
addition, some automated tools for testing are listed.

% \wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
%   come.}

% \subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

% \wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.  You should do more than list
%   names.  You should say what each person's role is for the project's
%   verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The SRS document \citep{SRS} will be reviewed by a domain expert.  The content
of the review is based on the following checklist:

\begin{todolist}
  \item Completeness: Included GS, A, GD, DD, TM, IM, etc.
  \item Formatting: The document has a clear, logical structure, and properly
  organized.
  \item Verifiability: Each requirement is testable with a clear pass/fail
  standard.
  \item Traceability: Each requirement is linked to an IM
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The Design Verification Plan will be reviewed by a domain expert.  The content
of the review is based on the following checklist:

\begin{todolist}
  \item Low module coupling: modules can be reused anywhere and do not affect
  others.
  \item Good Hierarchy: make sure the hierarchy is clear and easy to maintain.
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The Verification and Validation Plan (This document itself) will be reviewed by
a domain expert.  The content of the review is based on the following checklist:

\begin{todolist}
  \item Completeness : VnV plan includes all necessary sections.
  \item Formatting: The document has a clear, logical structure, and properly
  organized.
  \item Appropriateness: Confirm that the methods and tools proposed in the VnV
  plan are appropriate for the project.
  \item Coverage: Make sure the VnV plan covers all the requirements.
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\begin{todolist}
  \item Static code check: Tools (cpplint) will be used to automatically detect
  common issues such as memory leaks, uninitialized variables, and other code
  quality concerns.
  \item Test coverage: Tools (gcov) will be used to check test coverage and
  ensure that most of the code is covered by tests, increasing confidence in the
  correctness of the code.
  \item Unit test: Comprehensive unit tests will be executed in testing
  framework (gTest) to ensure that every units perform correctly.
  \item Code review: The developer will conduct his own code reviews, and the
  domain expert will also participate in code reviews if possible.
\end{todolist}

% \wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the
%   unit testing plan.}

% \wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
%   verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
%   walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

% \wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
% walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
% CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Static code checker: cpplint - A tool that enforces Google's C++ style
  guide by checking for common coding style violations.
  \item Unit test: gTest - A C++ testing framework that provides a rich set of
  assertions and test case management.
  \item Test coverage: gcov - A test coverage analysis tool for C++ that works
  with GCC.
  \item Local code quality control: git pre-commit - A framework that runs
  checks before committing code, helping to enforce coding standards and catch
  issues early.
  \item Continuous integration: GitHub Actions - An automation tool that enables
  CI/CD workflows, allowing code to be built, tested, and deployed
  automatically.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software will be validated using the
\href{https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/}{MIT-BIH} dataset, where
the system's performance will be assessed by calculating the Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual results. This will provide a
quantitative measure of the system's accuracy.

\section{System Tests}

% \wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap
% of the contents of the subsections.}

This section will provide the system tests designed to verify requirements of
the system, including functional and non-functional requirements.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
%   different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
%   level of document structure can be removed.}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the
%   requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

    \item $[1.44, 4.41, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0]$
  \end{itemize}
  
  Test Case Derivation: The purpose of this test case is to verify that the
  squaring function correctly squares each value in the input list, regardless
  of whether the numbers are positive or negative. The function should return
  the squared value of each element from the input list.

  The input given here is just an example.  In practice, the input will be a
  large amount of data randomly generated by the program for testing.

  function correctly applies dynamic thresholds to each element in the input
  sequence.  For each element in the sequence, if the value is greater than the
  corresponding threshold, it should remain unchanged; otherwise, it should be
  replaced with $0$.

  \end{itemize}
  
  Output:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $RMSE = 1.732$
  \end{itemize}
  
  Test Case Derivation: This test case verifies that the RMSE function correctly
  calculates the root mean squared error between two input sequences.  The RMSE
  is calculated as the square root of the mean of the squared differences
  between corresponding elements of the two sequences.
